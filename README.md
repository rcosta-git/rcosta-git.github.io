# Financial Analysis and Automated Trading

Hi everyone, this is Rob. I'm a senior systems developer, and I'm also working on a second master's degree at Tufts University in mathematics, after completing one in computer science.
This will be my third degree from Tufts overall, as I also completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics here.
I have been auditing graduate courses in economics and philosophy (spring 2025).

As an undergraduate, I was focused on pure mathematics, also spending several years in Tufts' Russian department with the intention of studying the works of Russian mathematicians in analysis and topology, and in 2015 I published a paper in number theory on $p$-adic dynamical systems, [A *p*-adic Perron-Frobenius Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01702).
I also became interested in set theory, type theory, category theory, and logic.

I am now focused on computer science&ndash;implementating algorithms for efficient systems operations and machine learning&ndash;and applied mathematics&ndash;the foundations of machine learning and financial analysis.
This site below contains a list of resources I've been compiling on financial analysis, quantitative methods, and automated trading.
[Let me know](mailto:robertcosta378@gmail.com) if you're interested in collaborating.
Thank you! &mdash;Rob, 2/1/25

## Book References

- For fundamental analysis, look at Murphy's [Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications](https://github.com/ShamaUgale/myBooks/blob/master/John%20J%20Murphy%20-%20Technical%20Analysis%20Of%20The%20Financial%20Markets.pdf).
- For technical analysis, check out Graham and Dodd's [Security Analysis: Principles and Technique](https://glenbradford.com/files/Stocks/security-analysis-benjamin-graham-6th-edition-pdf-february-24-2010-12-08-am-3-0-meg.pdf).
- For bonds and yields, the standard is Leibowitz and Homer's [Inside the Yield Book](https://archive.org/details/insideyieldbookn00home).
- The best book I know on machine learning is Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf).
- Some good books include "High Probability Trading," "Option Volatility and Pricing," Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets," "Options Trading: The Bible", "Mind over Markets."
- For more historical perspectives, I also enjoy reading the Market Wizards books, When Genius Failed, and Michael Lewis's writings from the last few decades such as Liar's Poker.
- Also for more general tips, "The Money Game," "Mastering the Trade" and "Trading in the Zone," or memoirs like "How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market" from Nicolas Darvas and "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" about Jesse Livermore.

## Mathematicians who have had trading success
- Leibowitz of Inside the Yield Book had a PhD in math before going into finance.
- Professor Edward Thorp started one of the first hedge funds based on statistical arbitrage. Check out his autobiography "A Man for all Markets," along with "Beat the Dealer" and "Beat the Market."
- Alongside Thorp as one of the first "quants" who applied mathematical and algorithmic principals to Wall Street is Jim Simons, known in math for the Chern-Simons form, and famous publicly for his hedge fund Rennaissance Technology and its Medallion Fund. His life is chronicled in the biography "The Man Who Solved the Market."

### Videos about understanding options

- Pretty much all complex options strategies are made by combining different types of spreads. These all require level 3 options trading. For a basic overview of options, start [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiybniIIvx0). You may also want to start learning about [the Greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCJcEOYuuII).
- Here is a nice video on long vertical spreads, also called debit spreads, which is probably the most similar to buying calls or puts directly. The difference is you somewhat offset theta decay (though also limiting your maximum possible gain) by simultaneously selling an equal number of options. [Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVswX2V_vE)
- Here is another video, by the same channel, on short vertical spreads, also called credit spreads. This is where you are trying to profit from theta decay and taking on the role of the "option seller." The problem with selling options though, is that your losses can be huge if the options you sold end up in the money, so you can offset those risks by buying an equal number of options that are further out of the money. This limits your total possible losses. [Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_0SbRaHv1U)
- If you want to go more in depth, there's a guy I used to watch who does pretty long detailed videos. [Here's his video on both types of vertical spreads.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwttDWfDQ9c)
- There is also the wheel, which requires owning the underlying stock. [Here's a video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcsErh9Airs&t=395s)
- Once you start watching these videos, you'll find a lot of similar channels with different people's explanations and strategies, so I encourage you to explore and discover new channels that work for you!
