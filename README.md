Hi everyone, this is Rob's page on quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. A lot of what happens at the hedge funds doing quantitative analysis is [quite secretive](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/renaissance-millennium-settle-trade-secrets-dispute), but I am hoping to work on making some finance models more accessible, while keeping some of the code I develop still private between me and my collaborators. Below is some published literature on portfolio analysis and hedging, lists of research journals, classic economics texts, options and futures video tutorials, and more. Investors should contact [Costa Capital Technologies](mailto:owner@CostaCapital.org), which I'm starting up as a nonprofit to support research and development in quantitative analysis of the stock market, structured with for-profit subsidiaries, following the examples of companies like Patagonia and OpenAI. A prototype of our platform is available [here](https://candlesage.streamlit.app/), and I'm actively fundraising to improve it. For my math and logic interests, see my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9bvsojRLzQ4fmVhUGdoby1URFRYYVZmMnh4dDFGLVc2YmdUVW5SdEdzZXl4OGF4ajcxajQ?resourcekey=0-XWGB5GzqOjIy6syC3Ah8qw&usp=sharing).

It emphasizes the interconnectedness of economic phenomena and the need for a systematic approach to understanding economic systems. 
- Ragnar Frisch coined the term *econometrics* in 1926 for utilising statistical methods to describe economic systems, as well as the terms *microeconomics* and *macroeconomics* in 1933, was one of the founders of the Econometric Society, and served as the first editor of the *Econometrica* journal from 1933 to 1954. His speech accepting the first Nobel Prize in Economics in 1969 is [From Utopian Theory to Practical Applications: The Case of Econometrics](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/frisch-lecture-1.pdf).

## Books on trading psychology and methodology
- Some good books on trading include *High Probability Trading*, *Option Volatility and Pricing*, *Options Trading: The Bible*, *Get Rich With Options*, and *Mind over Markets*.
- For more historical perspectives on trading, I also enjoyed reading the *Market Wizards* books, *When Genius Failed*, and Michael Lewis's writings from the last few decades such as *Liar's Poker*.
- Also for more general tips, *The Money Game*, *Mastering the Trade*, and *Trading in the Zone*, or memoirs like *How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market* from Nicolas Darvas and *Reminiscences of a Stock Operator* about Jesse Livermore.

## Mathematicians who have had trading success
- Leibowitz of *Inside the Yield Book* had a PhD in math before going into finance.
- Professor Edward Thorp started one of the first hedge funds based on statistical arbitrage. Check out his autobiography *A Man for all Markets*, along with *Beat the Dealer* and *Beat the Market*.
- Alongside Thorp as one of the first "quants" who applied mathematical and algorithmic principals to Wall Street is Jim Simons, known in math for the Chern-Simons form, and famous publicly for his hedge fund Rennaissance Technology and its Medallion Fund. His life is chronicled in the biography *The Man Who Solved the Market*.

### Understanding options
Options contracts are a type of derivative instrument, because they are *derived* from an underlying asset (a security specified by a stock symbol), a strike price, and an expiration date. A **call** option gives you the right to *buy* 100 shares of a security at the strike price before the expiration date, and a **put** option gives you the right to *sell* 100 shares of a security at the strike price before the expiration date. The current value of an options contract is a function of the time remaining until expiration, the current price of the underlying security, and the volatility. The **intrinsic value** is the amount of money that can be made by exercising the contract at expiration if it were to expire today; if it expires *in the money*, meaning the stock price is currently above the strike price for calls, or below the strike price for puts, then this is given by the difference between the current price of the stock and the strike price, multiplied by 100. Otherwise, it is *out of the money*, and the intrinsic value is just $0 (it has no intrinsic value). The **extrinsic value** (or **time value**) is the value derived from the uncertainty and volatility when there is still time remaining until expiration. The total value is the sum of these. Since the time value exponentially decays down to $0 by the expiration date (a process called "theta decay" or "time decay"), at expiration the total value of the option is just the intrinsic value, which may also be $0. Holders of options contracts often will try to sell before expiration, to avoid the decaying value. Sellers of options profit from time decay, but may still close before expiration to limit risk. Complex options strategies may have multiple *legs*, composed of buying and selling calls and puts at various strike prices and expiration dates, but they are still always either net long or net short on the underlying.

- Pretty much all complex options strategies are made by combining different types of spreads. These all require level 3 options trading. For a basic overview of options, start [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiybniIIvx0). You may also want to start learning about [the Greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCJcEOYuuII).
- Here is a nice video on long vertical spreads, also called debit spreads, which is probably the most similar to buying calls or puts directly. The difference is you somewhat offset theta decay (though also limiting your maximum possible gain) by simultaneously selling an equal number of options. [Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVswX2V_vE)
- Here is another video, by the same channel, on short vertical spreads, also called credit spreads. This is where you are trying to profit from theta decay and taking on the role of the "option seller." The problem with selling options though, is that your losses can be huge if the options you sold end up in the money, so you can offset those risks by buying an equal number of options that are further out of the money. This limits your total possible losses. [Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_0SbRaHv1U)
- If you want to go more in depth, there's a guy I used to watch who does pretty long detailed videos. [Here's his video on both types of vertical spreads.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwttDWfDQ9c)
- There is also the wheel, which requires owning the underlying stock. [Here's a video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcsErh9Airs&t=395s)
- For an explanation of options pricing, see [The Trillion Dollar Equation (Black-Scholes/Merton)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Utm21VuuJo).
- Once you start watching these videos, you'll find a lot of similar channels with different people's explanations and strategies, so I encourage you to explore and discover new channels that work for you!

### Understanding futures
Futures, like options, are also a type of derivative, whose price is based on an underlying asset, whether it's an index (e.g., for E-mini S&P futures contracts), or commodities like gold, Bitcoin, corn, and oil. While futures have an expiration date, and quite a bit of leverage, their profit and loss settles to the difference with the underlying more linearly, in a way that is more comparable to forex. The margin requirements offset the leverage they provide, and further leverage can be provided by trading options on futures.
